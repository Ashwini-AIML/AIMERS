8,Google,Amarprakash Temple Waves,Sridharan Narasimhan,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",a year ago,All 5 star ratings are from whom I don't understand. They promised delivery in 2016. Still not handed over. Full payment already done.I am editing this message on 30th September 2021. The property was handed over to me a couple of week ago. There was a huge delay but not a denial. I sent an email to them asking for a status. Their representative called me to ask me to  inspect the flat and collect the keys. I did so although it was only 90% complete.Thank you Amarprakash. God helps.
9,Google,Amarprakash Temple Waves,MP Vishnu Menon,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",2 years ago,It's okay. Not bad if you want to stay away from large public and small congested places. It is spacious and can give you a nice scenic change if you want that. Just it is too interior and do not have proper cab facilities and hard to commute that's why. Roads are not that great. Markets are nearby but you would need a bike if you feel like going to a market. Water supply is present. And you won't find issues with that. But with food order and all if you have stayed in a main place or heart of the city where you find multiple food options then you will miss those in this place. As zomato and swiggy do not have much options and also you won't have restaurants nearby..
10,Google,Amarprakash Temple Waves,Blessen B,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"The place currently features good water supply alongside filtered R.O. water (mornings to night, and all days except Mondays) where both is available at your taps at home assuming you've paid the maintenance cost which is pricey. The Recreational Center or something like that which'll feature a public gym and swimming pool probably is under construction among other buildings which most likely will become more residential areas so it might take more time as most of the resources are spread open. The security system is quite good as security guards can contact home owners through a readily available app (which is quite advanced here for me) in case of someone coming to visit such as a delivery courier or someone else entirely. As a lot of vehicles have been there for a very long time which can be told by the quite easily visible gray dust that settles on top of them, it tells two things. Not alot of owners are present probably and security isn't that weak either so yeah. A visit will fill you in on the details which I might have left out which you had wanted to know. Hope this review helped!"
11,Google,Amarprakash Temple Waves,R Krishna,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",2 years ago,"Hello everyone ,We booked a flat on 2012. They promised to gave keys on 2015 but they delayed and gave on 2016 only. While handover ceremony they said 3 sets of keys are given to all the flat owners but we got only 2 sets.  They lost 1 set of key for our flat. We ask them lot of times for this issue but till date we are not getting our keys. Very much disappointed. No proper response from their side. Apart from that this apartment is situated in very peaceful area. Friendly neighbours.  24/7 security service, lifts, electricity backups, RO water,  good groundwater, children's playarea."

13,Google,Amarprakash Temple Waves,Ramji Sridharan,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",4 years ago,"Worst developers and shame of people working there.Until you book an apartment only itâ€™s easy to contact them, once you pay your booking amount you cannot  even speak them and cannot get any response from them. They never attend  your phone calls.They never hand over any project at time. Itâ€™s has been more than 2.5 years that I have been booked an apartment with temple waves and complete payment was done an year back still I havenâ€™t got my home...They always say it as a dream home and I think itâ€™s going to be only my dream.Donâ€™t ever book a property with Amarprakash, you will definite regret for it if you do so..."

15,Google,Amarprakash Temple Waves,jayashree Pillai,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 years ago,"Hello, I booked a flat in Temple waves. Mr Faizal was the sales person. He promised so many things and when i wanted to have a look at the flat,  it was in a filthy condition, (this is after paying token amount of 6 lakhs).  Now it is over a month the bank and cleared the loan and transferred to Amarpraksh. i have had no response from them about the registration. I have called Mr.Faizal and their Land line number for over a week but no response. I think i did a mistake taking this apartment but cannot do anything about it now. But if you are planning to buy one and have shortlisted Amarpraksh,  please don,t fall  pray to their usual sales gimmicks."
16,Google,Amarprakash Temple Waves,Arun kumar,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 years ago,These guys are cheating fellows. Do not ever prefer this builder to buy flats.We paid the amount 10k to book an apartment and they said that will be refunded if we are not interested to buy.Six months happened they have not refunded and not responding properly.if they are not honest for 10k how do we expect the quality apartment after paying more than 30lakhs.

29,Google,Amarprakash Temple Waves,Venkataswamy Rajagopal,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",4 years ago,"Inaccessible by public transport.  Beware of Amarprakash builders.  They quote you one amount before purchase, after you commit yourself,  they show you an agreement and wont give you Possession Letter or NDC.  I have one flat D-503.  I paid amount for car parking long ago,  and they have alloted one for me which is non existence.  Nor they are telling it is under construction.  Say a big no to this cheats or learn yourself."
